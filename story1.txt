The Promise
Aarav: "Mira... it's me."

Mira: "...I didn’t think I’d ever hear from you again."

Aarav: "I’m sorry. I should have kept in touch. But… I had to see you."

Mira hesitated for a moment before replying.

Mira: "Where are you?"

Aarav: "At the lake… our spot."

A long silence. Then, finally—

Mira: "Wait there."

Aarav’s heart pounded as he stood under the old oak tree, where they had spent countless evenings as kids. The wooden swing still hung there, slightly worn but sturdy. He turned at the sound of soft footsteps.

Mira stood a few feet away, arms crossed. Her face carried emotions he couldn’t quite decipher—relief, anger, pain.

Mira: "You really came."

Aarav: "I never forgot my promise."

Mira let out a bitter laugh.

Mira: "People make promises all the time, Aarav. And then they leave."

Aarav took a step closer.

Aarav: "I thought leaving was the right thing to do… I thought I was chasing a future for both of us."

Mira: "And did you ever think of what it was like for me? Waiting? Hoping? And then… giving up?"

Her voice cracked, and Aarav felt the weight of his mistakes pressing down on him. He reached for her hand, but she pulled away.

Aarav: "I regret it, Mira. Every single day."

Mira: "Regret doesn’t change anything."

Aarav: "But second chances do."

For the first time, Mira’s gaze softened. She sighed, shaking her head.

Mira: "You always were terrible at goodbyes."

Aarav smiled, a hopeful glimmer in his eyes.

Aarav: "That’s why I don’t want to say it ever again."

Mira studied him for a long moment. Then, with the faintest of smiles, she sat on the old swing.

Mira: "If you’re staying, you owe me ice cream. And a thousand explanations."

Aarav chuckled, sitting beside her.

Aarav: "Deal."

And under the golden evening sky, the past pain began to fade—slowly, but surely—replaced by the quiet promise of a new beginning.
